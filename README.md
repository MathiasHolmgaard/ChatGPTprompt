# ChatGPTprompt

This is a hobby test kind of project of my own.

The project is to make chatGPT write the code for a console app that can prompt chatGPT through your own API for chatGPT.

Instrucitons to use this bad boy:

Step 1

Visit: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
- Create your own secret key

Step 2

Insert that key in the file: appsettings.json
- Where it says: 
{
  "OpenAI": {
    "ApiKey": "HERE IS WHERE YOU PASTE YOUR KEY"
  }
}

Step 3

Run and prompt away
